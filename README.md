# Computer Vision RPS
Milestone 1: set up github as required.
Milestone 2: Set inputs into "teachable machine" so it works properly. Downloaded and uploaded the files onto the repository.
Milestone 3 and 4: Downloaded the template, numbers are giving correct results with the tensorflow file. I set up the manual rps game, uplaoded code onto repo.
